# Challenge:
# Print a triangle based on the user's input. The number should specify how many lines. It should work for any number.
# E.g., if the user inputs 3, it should print:  If the user inputs 4, it should print:
#   *                                              *
#  ***                                            ***
# *****                                          *****
#                                               *******
# Good luck! (^_^)
# Note: Do not print anything inside `input()`; the way the check script checks your output, it must only output the triangle.
