# Learn Python!

## About

These challenges were created for my friends Jarrod and Yuyu to help them learn the fundamentals of programming in Python.

## How To

First, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

As you solve each challenge, run `python check.py XX.py`, where `XX` is the challenge number.
This script will check to see if your code outputs the correct answers.

> Note: Some challenges do not have a right answer; e.g., 0 and 7
