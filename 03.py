# Challenge:
# Print a diamond based on the user's input. The number should specify the height of the top half. It should work for any number.
# E.g., if the user inputs 2, it should print:  If the user inputs 3, it should print:
#   *                                              *
#  ***                                            ***
#   *                                            *****
#                                                 ***
#                                                  *
# Good luck! (^_^)
# Note: Do not print anything inside `input()`; the way the check script checks your output, it must only output the diamond.
