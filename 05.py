'''
Given a sequence of numbers from standard input separated by spaces, print them out in reverse order.
E.g., given the input "1 2 3 4 5", your program should print out: "5 4 3 2 1"

Note: Do not print anything inside `input()`; the way the check script checks your output, it must only output the answer.
